# Hi, my name is Vince! 

I am looking for a position as a front-end engineer. Originally a graphic designer with two years of work experience, specializing in communicating requirements and focusing on visual design for user experience. I transitioned to the software industry because I want to develop products that are more widely used. My current goal is to utilize my design experience and communication skills in a new role as a frontend engineer to reduce communication costs and achieve more efficient development, making contributions to the team.
