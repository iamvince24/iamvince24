# Hi, my name is Vince!üëã

I am looking for a position as a front-end engineer.

I have two years of experience working as a graphic designer, where I excelled in solving problems through effective communication and implementing designs that prioritize attention to detail and user experience.

Due to my strong interest and enthusiasm for the field of information technology, I began exploring this area by taking computer science courses in 2021. Upon entering graduate school in 2022, I delved into the application of AI computer vision in the field. Eventually, driven by my passion for frontend technologies, I started self-learning frontend-related skills from mid-2023.

Currently, I specialize in React with Redux for development, utilize Firebase for CRUD API creation, and design RWD websites using Tailwind CSS, styled-components, and SCSS. I am well-versed in the Git/Github flow development process.
